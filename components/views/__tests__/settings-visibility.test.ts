/**
 * Which settings the simple view offers.
 *
 * The rule is whether someone can finish their own editing loop without the pane, not whether it
 * looks advanced. Connections and Models stay: a person who cannot choose a provider or a model
 * cannot use the product at all, and switching model is the way out of a provider that has stopped
 * answering. Cost Tracking stays because the keys are the person's own and so is the bill. Mail is
 * instance administration and is not part of anyone's editing.
 *
 * The sidebar keeps its own copy of these flags for the menu shortcuts; this is the list the
 * settings view itself renders, which is the one that decides what is reachable.

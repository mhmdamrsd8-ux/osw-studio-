 * `collate` is tested as a function in `lib/quick-edit/__tests__/collate.test.ts`; the sentence it
 * produces is not re-asserted here. What needs a DOM is the choice this component makes *around*
 * that sentence: a stretch of one step is shown as that step, and only a longer one is folded
 * behind a disclosure. A version that collated everything passes every assertion about `collate`
 * and still puts a single row behind a caret, restated in more general words.

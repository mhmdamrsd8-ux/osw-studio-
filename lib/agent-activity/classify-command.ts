/**
 * Which group a shell command belongs to in the transcript.
 *
 * Four buckets, and they are a display grouping rather than a description: they pick the icon and
 * the heading a tool call gets, and `agent` is also how the processor finds the sub-agent call whose
 * progress it is following. `parseCommand` in this directory answers the other question, what the
 * command did and to which file, in around eighteen kinds.
 *
 * The two are not one function because the coarser answer is not a fold of the finer one:
 *
 * - `echo "---"` parses as an edit, since `echo` is how a file gets appended to, but on its own it
 *   writes nothing and belongs in `bash`. Folding every writing kind into `write` would move it.
 * - `sed -i "s/a/b/" file.txt` names a relative target, which `parseCommand` refuses as a path, so
 *   the presence of a path cannot stand in for "this wrote something" either.
 * - A heredoc is a write whatever opens it, including a verb `parseCommand` does not know (`tee`).
 *
 * So the `agent` and `status` buckets are derived, which is where the duplication actually cost
 * something: both files carried the `agent|delegate` spelling, and the alias has been renamed once
 * already. The write rules stay written out here, at the granularity this answer needs.

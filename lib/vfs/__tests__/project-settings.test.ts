/**
 * Reading settings that are not the record the type promises.
 *
 * Every shape asserted here was read out of a real workspace database rather than invented: a
 * `settings` held as a JSON string, one stringified repeatedly until it was mostly escapes, and one
 * spread into character keys. None of it throws -- `settings.runtime` on a string is just
 * `undefined` -- which is why it went unnoticed while a handlebars project lost its selection
 * toolbar and runtimes appeared to reset themselves.
 *
 * The fallback is asserted through `resolveRuntime` rather than by reading the constant, because
 * the bug was two call sites disagreeing about the absent case, not the value either chose.

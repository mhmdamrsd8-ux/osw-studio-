/**
 * Reading a project's settings, and deciding its runtime.
 *
 * `Project['settings']` is typed as an object, and stored data does not always agree. A project
 * written back straight from a JSON API response keeps whatever that response held -- the same
 * reason `hydrateProject` re-makes the dates -- and for settings that has meant a JSON *string*
 * where an object belongs. Once one is stored, `updateProject` re-encodes it on the way to SQLite
 * (`JSON.stringify(project.settings ?? {})`), so each round trip wraps it in another layer, and
 * anything doing `{ ...project.settings, x }` spreads the characters of the string into keys
 * `"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"`.
 *
 * None of that throws. `settings.runtime` on a string is `undefined`, so the project reads as
 * having no runtime and every consumer falls back -- which is why a handlebars project lost its
 * selection toolbar while still compiling as handlebars, and why a runtime looked like it reset
 * itself.
 *
 * So the shape is repaired where a project is read, next to the dates, rather than at the writers:
 * the writers are already correct, the data is not, and a normalizer in the read path covers the
 * ones that have been and gone.

 * `return false` at `supportsDirectEditing`, which meant a project with no runtime compiled as
 * handlebars and was then offered the toolbar of a runtime that cannot have one.
